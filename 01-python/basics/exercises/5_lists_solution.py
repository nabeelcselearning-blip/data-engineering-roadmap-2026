# QUESTION 1
expenses = [2200, 2350, 2600, 2130, 2190]

# 1. In Feb, how many dollars you spent extra compare to January?

print(expenses[1] - expenses[0])

# 2. Find out your total expense in first quarter (first three months) of the year.
print(expenses[0] + expenses[1] + expenses[2])

# 3. Find out if you spent exactly 2000 dollars in any month
print(2000 in expenses)

# 4. June month just finished and your expense is 1980 dollar. Add this item to our monthly expense list
expenses.append(1980)

# 5. You returned an item that you bought in a month of April and
# got a refund of 200$. Make a correction to your monthly expense list
# based on this

expenses[3] -= 200

print(expenses)

# QUESTION 2
heros = ["spider man", "thor", "hulk", "iron man", "captain america"]

# 1. Length of the list
print(len(heros))

# 2. Add 'black panther' at the end of this list
heros.append("black panther")

# 3. You realize that you need to add 'black panther' after 'hulk',
#    so remove it from the list first and then add it after 'hulk'

heros.pop()
heros.insert(3, "black panther")

print(heros)


# 4. Now you don't like thor and hulk because they get angry easily :)
#    So you want to remove thor and hulk from list and replace them with doctor strange (because he is cool).
#    Do that with one line of code.

heros[1:3] = ["doctor strange"]
print(heros)

# 5. Sort the heros list in alphabetical order
# (Hint. Use dir() functions to list down all functions available in list)

heros.sort()
print(heros)
